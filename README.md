# Online Class Video Website

I made this simple website using **Gemini** to organize our online class videos.  
Earlier, the videos were sent through email, and it was hard for students to find them.  
So I arranged all the videos in one place and shared the website link in our class group.

## Features
- All class videos in one place  
- Easy to use  
- Clean and simple design  

## Purpose
To help my classmates access online class videos easily and stay organized.

## Tools Used
- Gemini  
- Basic HTML/CSS
